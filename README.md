# ApothAI - Pill Recognition

## Introduction

Pill misuse is a significant public health concern with far-reaching consequences. Misuse of prescription and over-the-counter medications can lead to health risks, addiction, and other adverse effects. Our open-source Pill Recognition Project aims to provide a solution to help individuals identify pills accurately and make informed decisions about their medication.

## Key Features

Our Pill Recognition Open-Source Project offers the following key features:

1. **Image Recognition:** Users can take a picture of a pill using their smartphone or upload an existing image. The project utilizes deep learning models to recognize and identify the pill based on its shape, color, markings, and other visual characteristics.

2. **Database Integration:** Our project is integrated with an open and comprehensive pharmaceutical database, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date information about the identified pill.

3. **Dosage Information:** Users will not only be able to identify the pill but also access essential information about its proper dosage, usage instructions, and potential side effects.

4. **Drug Interaction Warnings:** To enhance safety, the project can provide alerts about potential drug interactions if the identified pill is taken with other medications.

## How We Built It

Our Pill Recognition Open-Source Project is built on collaboration and transparency:

1. **Data Collection:** We have assembled a significant open-source dataset consisting of 133,000 pill images, encompassing a wide variety of prescription and over-the-counter medications. This dataset is available for anyone to use and contribute to.

2. **Deep Learning Models:** We employ state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to train the image recognition component of the project. These models can analyze the visual features of pills, including their shape, color, imprints, and more.

3. **Database Integration:** We integrate an open and accessible pharmaceutical database with the project, enabling users to access comprehensive information about the identified pill, including its name, manufacturer, usage instructions, and potential side effects.

4. **Safety Features:** To address the issue of pill misuse, we also include a drug interaction warning system that checks for potential interactions with other medications the user may be taking.

## Statistics on Pill Misuse

Misuse of prescription and over-the-counter medications is a widespread issue that affects many individuals. Here are some real statistics related to pill misuse:

- According to surveys, approximately 18 million people in the United States misused prescription medications in 2019.
- Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, with over 232,000 deaths reported from 1999 to 2019.
- The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reports that nearly 53 million people aged 12 and older have misused prescription drugs at least once in their lifetime.

## Research Papers We Drew Inspiration From

In the development of our Pill Recognition project, we drew inspiration from the following research papers related to image recognition, deep learning, and computer vision:
